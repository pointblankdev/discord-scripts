### Overview

**Gather Discord Integration**
Slash Commands allow users to interact with Gather on Discord by simply typing '/'. This repo contains scripts for creating new Slash Commands, editing existing ones and deleting them.
The src directory contains 'create', 'delete' and 'edit' folders.
Each Gather Slash Command has a javascript file for editing it and another for deleting in the respective 'edit' and 'delete' folders. The script file for creating it lives in the 'create' folder. <br>
